**Backbone validation plugin beta
version 0.9.**

This is a basic plugin for Backbone validation, and works in browser and in nodejs either. The validator has custom message support, so you can write error messages on your chosen language (this feature is part of the basic form example, not the package yet, and I think I'll extend it with several i18n plugin connectors).

Please look at the source code of example/index.html for plugin interface information. A detailed wiki is coming soon...
